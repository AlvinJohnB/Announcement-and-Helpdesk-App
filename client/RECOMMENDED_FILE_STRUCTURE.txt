- Group related components into feature folders (`announcements`, `helpdesk`, `endorsements`, `auth`).
- Move shared UI elements to `common/`.
- Centralize styles and assets.
- Keep `context/` for global state.

To refactor:
- Move each file into its recommended folder.
- Update all import paths in your JS files accordingly (e.g., from './components/AnnouncementList' to './components/announcements/AnnouncementList').
- Move CSS files to `assets/styles/` and update imports.
- Place images in `assets/images/` if needed.
- Test the app after moving files and updating imports.
